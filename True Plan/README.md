# Copilot Orchestration Extension (COE) — True Plan

**Version**: 1.1  
**Date**: February 9, 2026

---

## What Is This?

This is the **clean, definitive plan** for the Copilot Orchestration Extension (COE). It explains what the program is, how it works, and what it does — without any code, implementation details, or technical debt tracking.

Use this folder as the single source of truth for understanding the project's goals, design, and behavior.


The goal of this project is to. Guide powerful coding agents. Like copilot. To be more reliable. To be more helpful. To be more intelligent. To be more autonomous. To be more self-improving. To be more context-aware. To be more aligned with user intent.

To make a plan insert updates. Umm have improvements? Ask intelligent questions. Get an intelligent. Fully scoped breakdown of the end goal. Into a structured plan. With prioritized tasks. With clear instructions. With clear inputs and outputs. With clear success criteria. With clear edge cases.

easy design principles. Simple architecture. Clear operating principles. Continuous self-improvement. Pragmatic reliability.

And then guiding the coding agent to actually. Program. The exact plan? That was planned for the project being developed. Not just writing code. But writing the code that. Follows the plan. That achieves the goals. That meets the success criteria. That handles the edge cases. This is to take AI coding projects to the next level. To make them more reliable. More intelligent. More autonomous. More aligned with user intent.

## Quick Summary

**COE is a VS Code extension** that acts as an intelligent project manager between you and AI coding agents.

**You tell it what to build** → it creates a structured plan with prioritized tasks.

**AI coding agents (like Copilot) request tasks from COE** → COE feeds them one task at a time with full context.

**When the AI is confused, it asks COE** → specialized Answer agents provide evidence-based responses.

**When the AI finishes, COE verifies the work** → tests are run, results are compared against the plan.

**When things go wrong, COE adapts** → creates follow-up tasks, adjusts priorities, and learns from patterns.

**You stay in control** → approve critical decisions, review AI work, and steer priorities at any time.

## One-Sentence Summary

> COE is a plan-driven orchestration layer that breaks your project into atomic tasks, feeds them to AI coding agents one at a time, verifies the results, and continuously learns to do it better.
